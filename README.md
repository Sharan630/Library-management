# Library-management
A college library maintains the records of the books that are available in the library.
The records contain details like title, author, publisher, No of copies, and position in
the rack. When someone wants to issue the book, the librarian enter the detail title
and author and the system searches the records to find that whether the book is
available or not. If it is not, a new entry is created in the list of requested books. If
it is present, then the book is issued to the person and correspondingly the records
are modified.
